# Background and Purpose
Under the deregulated environment, electric utility companies have been encouraged to ensure maximum system reliability through the employment of cost-effective long-term asset management strategies. This project used four modified Weibull distribution models with straightforward physical meanings specific to power system applications. Furthermore, this project used a novel method to effectively evaluate different Weibull distribution models and select the suitable model(s). More importantly, if more than one suitable model exists, these models can be mathematically combined as a joint forecast model, which could provide better accuracy to forecast future asset reliability. 
# Modeling Method
The modeling method is described as follows and its flowchart is shown in Fig.1. Firstly, the operation status data of a specific asset population is analyzed and converted to a cumulative failure probability table. This table is then split into training pairs and testing pairs. Training pairs are used to model the asset failure progression using the proposed Weibull distributions models. Testing pairs are used to evaluate the forecast accuracy of the distribution models. The suitable Weibull distribution model(s) can be identified based on the model evaluation results. When there are more than one suitable Weibull distribution models, the models can be mathematically combined as a joint model. In the next stage, the combined joint model is applied to the broader asset population data and the future reliability change of this population is forecasted.

# Distribution Pole Failure Forecast
This method was also applied to a sample group consisting of 1000 distribution wood poles selected from one area. Different from electromechanical relays, these poles were installed from recent time to more than 80 years ago and there are no complete inspection records available for producing their health indices. Only installation and replacement records are available. These records indicate the age of poles and the time when some poles were replaced due to failures. In practice, lack of inspection records is a quite common problem for studying aging asset population which covers a relatively long time span. Many old paper based records could be missing. As discussed in Section IV, in cases like this, if the studied population operates in a homogenous environment, age can be used instead of health index to produce modified Weibull distribution models. In this case study, all poles were made of western red cedar, treated with the same type of chemical treatment (Chromated copper arsenate) and carrying straight conductors in one geographic area. Therefore, they can be reviewed as one type of asset and rely on age information for further modeling and forecast.

According to the asset engineer’s analysis, these poles do not have infant mortality like the electromechanical relays. The chemical treatment that manufacturers applied to the pole surface could effectively reduce the internal and external infestation for up to 20 years before the treatment gradually degrades under weather exposure and ultimately lose the protection effect. Therefore, excluding rare third-party damages such as vehicle collision, the probability of natural failures of distribution poles are extremely low in an initial period after installation. Based on this important prior knowledge, X-shift parameter γ is discretized as γ∈{5,10,15,20}. With the standard two-parameter model, in total 5 Weibull distribution models were established and evaluated. Their MSEs are calculated and ranked in Table I.

From Table I, top 3 models are selected as suitable models and to produce the joint model as shown in Fig.2. MSE is 0.0078 and better than any single Weibull distribution model listed in Table I.
